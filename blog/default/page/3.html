  <p>Git is a very popular version control system used to manage different versions of code. It was designed and developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 so he could manage the all the different versions of the Linux Kernel with the open source community. Git allows developers to track old versions of code, existing code, and new features all in directory by using the power of branches. Each Branch can store it&#39;s own unique version of the code.</p>

<p>To use Git, first the developer must initiate a Git repository by typing &#39;git init&#39; in the terminal under a directory of a project. This will create a hidden folder called &#39;.git&#39;. Git will track all the changes that are made in this hidden folder.</p>

<p>GitHub is a GUI version of Git on the web with some additional features. One cool feature is the ability to comment on changes that were made. GitHub has become the go to place for the open source developer community to share and collaborate with one another on code. Many companies even request to see job applicant&#39;s GitHub pages often instead of a resumes.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/11/02/dbc-experience.html">DBC Experience</a> <span>Nov  2</span></h2>
  <!-- use article.summary(250) if you have Nokogiri available to show just

  <h2>My thoughts</h2>

<p>I like the DBC experience. It&#39;s unique because, it&#39;s split up into a remote phase and an on-site phases.  The remote phase allows students to sharpen their programming.  When arrive on-site, students are better programmers and logical thinkers.</p>

<p>I also think that focusing on engineering with empathy is awesome because it teaches one how to be a well-balanced person in life.</p>

<p>I see myself learning a lot and also hope to share my knowledge about any cool tricks that I may know or figure out. I hope others also share their cool tricks with class as well. My expectations for DBC have not changed. I expect to put as much as I can in so I can get as much as I can out of the program while meeting awsome people at the same time.</p>

<p>I’m excited to push myself everyday. One random takeaway from the program so far is the pomodoro productivty method. I really like it a lot because it’s helping me stay productive so I can learn as much as possible. Also, I can’t wait to meet the NY Cohort in Janaury 2015. Anyways that’s it for now. Until next time.</p>

  <p>Ruby and JavaScript have different ideas about classes. Let&#39;s see examples below how they are similar and different.</p>

<h2>Ruby Class</h2>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Player

    attr_accessor :height, :dob, :stats, :picture, :rating, :name

    def initialize(name,height,dob,rating)
        @name = name
        @height = height
        @dob = dob
        @stats = {}
        @rating = rating
    end

    def printInfo
        puts &quot;name: #{@name}&quot;
        puts &quot;height: #{@height}&quot;
        puts &quot;dob: #{@dob}&quot;
        puts &quot;rating: #{@rating}&quot;
    end

end
</code></pre>

<p>The code above is an example of a Ruby class. I initialized some variables and then created a printInfo Method. Creating the Object in Ruby</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">require_relative &#39;classes.rb&#39;
p1 = Player.new(&quot;Rubin TI Jones&quot;,&quot;5&#39;11&quot;,&quot;01-13-1989&quot;,&quot;101&quot;) # (name,height,dob,rating)
p1.rating =&quot;105&quot;
p1.printInfo
</code></pre>

<p>In the Code above I include the Class and create a new instance of the object stored in p1. Then I call the printInfo function using <code>p1.printInfo</code>.</p>

<pre><code>name: Rubin TI
height: 5&#39;11
dob: 01-13-1989
rating: 101
</code></pre>

<h2>JavaScript constructor functions</h2>

<pre><code class="javascript"> player = function(name, height, dob, rating) {
    this.name = name,
    this.height = height,
    this.dob = dob,
    this.rating = rating,
    this.printInfo = function() {
        console.log(&quot;name: &quot; + this.name);
        console.log(&quot;height: &quot; + this.height);
        console.log(&quot;dob: &quot; + this.dob);
        console.log(&quot;rating: &quot; + this.rating);
        };
 };
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that to define a class in JavaScript it&#39;s a bit different that in Ruby. We have to use a constructor function so that we can initialize the new object with the name, height, dob, and rating parameters. You can also see that instead of using <code>@</code> next to each variable we use this.</p>

<h2>Creating the Object with JavaScript</h2>

<pre><code class="javascript">require(&#39;./t7-constructor_functions.js&#39;);
var p1 = new player(&quot;Rubin TI Jones&quot;, &quot;5&#39;11&quot;, &quot;01-13-1989&quot;, &quot;101&quot;);
p1.rating = &quot;105&quot;
p1.printInfo();
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that first we create a new object p1 and make it a new instance of player using
<code>var p1 = new player(parameters);</code>. Please note you need unhide the require line to get this to work on your machine. Then after we need to call the printInfo function on p1 we must write <code>p1.printInfo()</code> with parenthesis in order to properly call the function. As you can see below you get the same output to ther terminal.</p>

<p>You can see that first we create a new object called p1 and which is a new instance of Player.</p>

<p><code>var p1 = new player(parameters);</code></p>

<p>Now we have access to call the printInfo method on p1 we like so.</p>

<p><code>p1.printInfo();</code></p>

<p>As you can see below you get the same output to the terminal.</p>

<pre><code>name: Rubin TI Jones
height: 5&#39;11
dob: 01-13-1989
rating: 105
</code></pre>
